## Content
This repository consists of the notebooks and results used in our experiment.
- The `Notebook` directory contains the ipython notebooks used in our experiments.
- The `dataset` directory has the dataset used for 3, 4, 5 class classification. For 10 class classification we directly download the dataset in the notebook from `keras.datasets`. It also contains the latent space acquired from the Variational Autoencoder.
- The `result` directory has the `.npy` files for all our experiments.
- The `analysis` directory has the images in `.pdf` format for the accuracy comparisons among all the sampling techniques.
